# Session Summary: Project Onboarding - 2025-08-25

## Session Objective
Complete comprehensive onboarding for RAG MVP project using /sc:reflect command to establish baseline understanding and cross-session persistence.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Project Activation & Configuration
- Successfully activated `context-flow` project with Serena MCP integration
- Enabled interactive + editing modes for optimal development workflow
- Established cross-session memory persistence capabilities

### 2. Comprehensive Project Analysis
- **Purpose Identified**: RAG system for document upload, semantic search, and chunk correlation
- **Architecture Mapped**: Service-layered design (Core → Storage → API)
- **Tech Stack Catalogued**: FastAPI, sentence-transformers, SQLite, TF-IDF fallback
- **Testing Philosophy**: TDD with real integration testing (no mocks)

### 3. Codebase Structure Discovery
```
rag-mvp/src/
├── core/           # EmbeddingService, RAGService, TextProcessor  
├── storage/        # VectorStore
├── api/           # FastAPI endpoints
└── web/           # Static HTML/JS UI
```

### 4. Memory System Population
Created 5 comprehensive knowledge bases:
- `project_overview` - Core purpose and characteristics
- `codebase_structure` - Architecture and file organization  
- `suggested_commands` - Development workflows and testing
- `code_style_conventions` - Python/FastAPI guidelines
- `task_completion_checklist` - Quality gates and validation

## Technical Insights Captured

### Development Workflow
- Entry point: `python run.py` (uvicorn with auto-reload)
- Testing: `pytest -v` (real endpoint testing via TestClient)
- Manual verification: cURL commands for API endpoints
- No automated linting/formatting (manual PEP 8 compliance)

### Architecture Patterns  
- Service-oriented design with dependency injection
- Graceful fallback: sentence-transformers → TF-IDF
- Real-time indexing with in-memory vector search
- SQLite persistence with optional FAISS integration

## Session Context Preserved
- Complete project understanding established
- Development environment requirements documented  
- Quality gates and completion criteria defined
- Cross-session continuity enabled through memory persistence

## Next Session Readiness
✅ Project activated with persistent configuration  
✅ Comprehensive knowledge base established
✅ Development workflows documented
✅ Quality standards captured
✅ Memory system operational for future sessions

This onboarding session provides complete foundation for productive development work on the RAG MVP project.
