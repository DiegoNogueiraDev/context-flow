# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Marking a Task Complete

### 1. Testing Requirements
```bash
# Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken
pytest -v

# Verify specific components if changed
pytest tests/test_embedding_service.py -v
pytest tests/test_vector_store.py -v  
pytest tests/test_rag_service.py -v
```

### 2. Code Quality Checks
- **Type hints**: Ensure all new functions have proper type annotations
- **Error handling**: Check for proper exception handling
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings to new classes/methods
- **Code style**: Follow PEP 8 conventions

### 3. Integration Verification
```bash
# Start the development server
python run.py

# Verify endpoints work manually
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
curl http://localhost:8000/stats
```

### 4. No Linting/Formatting Tools
- The project doesn't currently have automated linting (flake8, black, mypy)
- Manual code review against PEP 8 standards
- Ensure consistent naming and style with existing code

### 5. Database/Storage Integrity
- Check that SQLite operations work correctly
- Verify vector embeddings are persisted properly
- Test document upload and search functionality

### 6. TDD Compliance
- All new features must have corresponding tests
- Tests should exercise real functionality, not mocks
- Integration tests should cover API endpoints end-to-end

## Quality Gates
1. ✅ All tests pass (`pytest`)
2. ✅ Manual verification works (`curl` tests)  
3. ✅ Code follows project conventions
4. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
5. ✅ New functionality is properly tested
